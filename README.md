# Object Builder

A desktop application for editing and managing graphical objects (things, sprites, items) for [OpenTibia](https://github.com/opentibia) game servers. Built with Electron, React, and TypeScript.

Object Builder allows you to open, inspect, edit, and compile Tibia client data files (`.dat`, `.spr`) as well as server-side item definitions (`.otb`, `items.xml`). It also supports the `.obd` (Object Builder Data) format for individual object import/export.

## Features

- **Full DAT/SPR editing** &mdash; Read and write client metadata (`.dat`) and sprite (`.spr`) files for Tibia client versions 7.10 through 13.10 (106 versions)
- **Server items support** &mdash; Load, edit, and save `items.otb` and `items.xml` for 8 TFS server versions (0.3.6 &ndash; 1.6)
- **OBD import/export** &mdash; Import and export individual objects in OBD format (v1/v2/v3) with LZMA compression
- **Sprite rendering** &mdash; Real-time Canvas 2D rendering with outfit colorization (HSI palette), multi-tile composition, zoom, and pan
- **Animation editor** &mdash; Standalone tool for creating sprite sheet animations with grid overlay, frame timeline, and playback controls
- **Object viewer** &mdash; Preview objects with direction controls, frame groups, and playback from loaded project or OBD files
- **Sprite slicer** &mdash; Import sprites from images with configurable grid, rotation, and flip operations
- **Asset store** &mdash; Browse and import objects from the [Open Assets](https://github.com/ottools/open-assets) remote repository
- **Optimization tools** &mdash; Remove duplicate/unused sprites, normalize frame durations, convert frame groups
- **Look type generator** &mdash; Generate XML snippets for outfit/item look types with live preview
- **Clipboard system** &mdash; Copy/paste objects, properties, or patterns between things with undo support
- **Undo/redo** &mdash; Full undo/redo history for all editing operations
- **Bulk editing** &mdash; Modify properties across multiple objects at once
- **Find/search** &mdash; Search things by name, properties, or patterns; find unused/empty sprites
- **Auto-save & recovery** &mdash; Crash recovery, automatic backup before compile, unsaved changes confirmation
- **Internationalization** &mdash; English, Spanish, and Portuguese (BR) translations
- **Light/Dark theme** &mdash; System-aware theme with manual override
- **Cross-platform** &mdash; Windows, macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon), and Linux

## Download

Pre-built installers are available for Windows, macOS, and Linux on the [latest release](https://github.com/valerioleite/electron-object-builder/releases/latest) page.

| Platform | Format | Architecture |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | `.exe` (NSIS installer) | x64 |
| Windows | `.exe` (portable) | x64 |
| macOS | `.dmg` | x64, arm64 (Apple Silicon) |
| Linux | `.AppImage` | x64 |
| Linux | `.deb` | x64 |

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18 or later
- npm 9 or later

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/valerioleite/electron-object-builder.git
cd electron-object-builder

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Development

```bash
# Start in development mode with hot reload
npm run dev
```

The application will open with the renderer connected to Vite's dev server for hot module replacement.

## Building

```bash
# Production build (compile only)
npm run build

# Package for the current platform (installer)
npm run dist

# Platform-specific packaging
npm run dist:win     # Windows (NSIS installer + portable)
npm run dist:mac     # macOS (DMG, x64 + arm64)
npm run dist:linux   # Linux (AppImage + deb)
```

Packaged output goes to the `dist/` directory.

## Testing

```bash
# Unit and component tests (Vitest)
npm run test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch

# End-to-end tests (Playwright, requires build)
npm run test:e2e

# Build + E2E in one step
npm run test:e2e:build

# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Lint
npm run lint

# Format check
npm run format:check
```

The test suite includes **1925 unit/component tests** across 43 files and **28 E2E tests** across 6 files.
